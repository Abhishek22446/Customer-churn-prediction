# Customer-churn-prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn from historical customer data. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn are used for data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation. The model helps organizations identify at-risk customers and improve retention through data-driven insights.
